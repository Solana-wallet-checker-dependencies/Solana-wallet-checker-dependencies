## Getting Started: Download or Build, Then Install Dependencies

You can download a pre-compiled build, or build the project yourself. Building the project from source and understanding how to manage your Solana wallet checker dependencies is crucial for security and customization.

## Building the Project: Dependency Management

This section outlines the steps for handling the Solana wallet checker dependencies, ensuring a successful build process.

### Installing Dependencies Using vcpkg (Recommended):

*   **vcpkg** simplifies dependency management, making it easier to build.
    1.  If you donâ€™t have **vcpkg** yet, clone the repository and install it by following the instructions on the [official page](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).
    2.  Add vcpkg to your system PATH.
    3.  Run the following commands in your terminal:

        -   Install **OpenSSL**:
            ```bash
            vcpkg install openssl
            ```

        -   Install **nlohmann-json**:
            ```bash
            vcpkg install nlohmann-json
            ```

        -   Install **Crypto++**:
            ```bash
            vcpkg install cryptopp
            ```

        -   Install **libsodium**:
            ```bash
            vcpkg install libsodium
            ```
    4.  Build the project.

### Building via Visual Studio:

1.  Open the project solution in Visual Studio.
2.  Make sure **vcpkg** is correctly integrated.
3.  Click **Build** -> **Build Solution**.
4.  The executable will be in the `bin` folder.

### Building with Another C++ Compiler:

1.  Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2.  Compile using (example):

    ```bash
    g++ -o solanachecker main.cpp -lssl -lcrypto -lsodium -lcryptopp -std=c++17
    ```

## Command Line: After Dependencies are Met

Use the command line once the dependencies are correct:

1.  **-s / -search**: Brute-force.
2.  **-t / -track (ADDRESS)**: Track.
3.  **-g / -gen (NUMBER)**: Generate.
4.  **-m / -mnemonic (MNEMONIC)**: Show wallet info.
5.  **-b / -balance (ADDRESS)**: Check balance.
